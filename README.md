# Anonymise Proximity Tracking

When looking at tracking phone location data in order to track and test people exposed to infectious diseases like COVID-19, privacy concerns arise.

This is a simple attempt to do combined hashing of time buckets and location grid in order to reduce the privacy implications of the tracking required to manage an epidemic.

To use, with Python 3:

* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `jupyter-lab`

Or simply view [map-scrambling.ipynb](map-scrambling.ipynb) on github.
